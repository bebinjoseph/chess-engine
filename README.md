#### 13/03/24
Today I created the repo and as and when i make updates to the repo, ill provide a brief description of the update here with the dates
Also, now I have used linalg to express the board, I was thinking of using a gui to show the board but my main goal is to implement the algorithms
I will worry about aesthetics later
